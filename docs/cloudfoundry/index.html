<h3 id="cloud-foundry-introduction">Cloud Foundry Introduction</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="why-cloud-foundry">Why Cloud Foundry?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>It is difficult to deliver applications that are valuable to you, your organization, and/or the world if you aren’t able to focus on building the application itself.</li>
  <li>Application developers are not system administrators or system operators, nor should they be compelled to be.</li>
  <li>It is hard to build a consistent, reliable, secure, and highly available production environment. Much more so by stitching together compute, storage, and network capacity into a cohesive system that meets the demands of modern enterprises and the expectations of application consumers.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the problems that Cloud Foundry was made to address: ending the eternal battle of the developer’s focus on apps versus operating and engineering the platform that those applications are run upon.</p>

<p>Cloud Foundry does this by bringing about enterprise-grade <strong>application virtualization.</strong> It does this by harnessing and orchestrating a symphony of containers into an elastically scalable distributed system comprising all of the components a given application needs to serve the world. This changes the game much the way VMware did with VMs and server virtualization. Cloud Foundry is a proven application virtualization platform that gives control back to the developer, allowing developers to focus on developing applications, instead of infrastructure operations.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="what-is-paas">What is PaaS?</h4>
<p>While, generally, <em>IaaS</em> is server focused and <em>SaaS</em> is user focused, <em>PaaS</em> is developer focused. PaaS enhances developer productivity by enabling <strong>application virtualization</strong>, so there is a significant reduction in the need for developers to perform the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with the plumbing that detracts from the actual work on application code and concerns. Often this is called <strong>yak shaving.</strong> For instance, it may include everything from installing application runtimes, dependencies, app packaging, staging, and deployment, to configuring deeper down the stack into infrastructure concerns such as configuring load balancers, networking, security, provisioning VMs—nearly anything that takes your focus off building a great application.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="what-is-cloud-foundry">What is Cloud Foundry?</h4>
<p>Cloud Foundry is a platform for developing and running cloud-native applications. It is a polyglot platform that allows you to deploy a myriad of applications written in many different computer languages — Java, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Go, .NET languages, and many more. Simply use the best language for the task at hand with the freedom of knowing that Cloud Foundry supports it.</p>

<p>Cloud Foundry is IaaS agnostic and open source. It abstracts away the underlying IaaS whether you run on VMware vSphere, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, OpenStack, or others. This means that true application portability is possible regardless of the infrastructure choices and it enables a consistent multi-cloud strategy — public, private, or hybrid.</p>

<p>As a developer, Cloud Foundry does the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enables you to focus on building applications</li>
  <li>Moves you out of the VM provisioning game</li>
  <li>Allows you to recreate an application’s runtime environment continuously</li>
  <li>Deploys and scales an application in seconds</li>
  <li>Externalizes and injects environment-specific dependencies</li>
  <li>Has an API that enhances release management productivity</li>
  <li>Uses containers to isolate apps and create application virtualization</li>
  <li>Manages your application’s entire life cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>Some Cloud Foundry based PaaS providers have their own UI. PWS has Apps Manager UI.

<h3 id="users-orgs-spaces-and-roles">Users, Orgs, Spaces, and Roles</h3>

<p>In cloud foundry, <strong>Organizations or Orgs</strong> are representation of a Group, A Business Unit or A Department. Each Org has a resource quota for memory, app instaces etc,. 
Orgs have many spaces. These spaces are contain Applications and Services. There are roles to manage these Orgs and Spaces. The users in these rules manage Orgs and Spaces 
with resource allocation.</p>

<p>A <strong>Space</strong> is where the applications are pushed to. All service bindings are created and managed within a space. Spaces can be mapped to a specific environment, such as development, testing, integration, or production. Spaces can also be mapped to a sub-team under the Business Unit, Application, or Product Group. Services used by applications are scoped by Spaces. Developers push their applications into Space and then continue to develop and maintain their applications in the same space.If a given Space requires a different resource quota than the one defined at the Org, then the Cloud Foundry administrator or the Org Manager of that Org can create a custom resource quota and assign it to Space.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/docs/cloudfoundry/orgs_and_spaces.jpg" alt="Alt Orgs AndS paces" /></p>

<p>A <strong>user account</strong> allows a user to log in to Cloud Foundry and perform certain operations that are limited by the roles assigned to them by the Cloud Foundry Administrator.The user accounts can be created at an Org or Space level, based on the role they play in the organization. The same user can administer the Org and Space, or can be restricted to pushing applications to a given Space or Spaces.Additionally, a user can span across multiple spaces in an Org, and under each Space, they can be controlled by the Space role.</p>

<p>There is a big list of Roles a user can have. <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/roles.html">Read here</a></p>

<h4 id="apps-routes-domains-and-buildpacks">Apps, Routes, Domains, and Buildpacks</h4>

<p>In Cloud Foundry, an Applicaiton is an abstraction of one or several identical servers called instances which run the same code.
These instances follow a template called buildpack. A buildpack provides framework and runtime support -e.g. a preconfigured Java Web server.
A buildpack defines the server configuration and setup and we just need to push code which can be run in such an environment.</p>

<p>Cloud Foundry comes with a number of system-buildpacks for commonly used frameworks like Node.js, Rails, Java, .Net etc,. There are many community buildpacks too.</p>

<p>When creating a new application, we can explicitly specify its buildpack. If no buildpack is provided, Cloud Foundry will try to guess which one to use, which can lead 
to an error if there are multiple matching buildpacks.</p>

<p>As stated, Application can have multiple servers/instances. So how do we make them appear as a single instance to the developer and the end user? In a typical IaaS environment, we would add a load balancer “in front of them” to route all the traffic across the instances. The CF approach to this is to use the so called <strong>Route</strong>, which is an address 
associated with an Application. Routing is how incoming traffic is distributed across application instances. Under the hood, Cloud Foundry takes care of the details -e.g. load balancing, web-sockets, sticky sessions, and caching.</p>

<p>Every organization has one or several domains. Each route’s address within an organization should fall within one of these domains. For example, if a route has address
myapp.route.com, then there must be a domain route.com in its organization.</p>

<p>Applications which are not accessed online (e.g. background batch processing jobs) do not need routes.</p>

<p>Here’s how we can work with apps, buildpacks, and routes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># List all apps in the space
cf apps

# Details for a specific app
cf app [app-name]

# List all predefined buildpacks
cf builpacks

# List all domains in the organisation
cf domains

# Creates the "route.com" domain and all 
# of its routes in the current org
cf create-domain [org-name] route.com

# Remove the "route.com" domain
cf delete-domain route.com

# List all routes in the space
cf routes

# Create a new route: "myapp.route.com"
cf create-route [space-name] route.com --hostname myapp

# Map "myapp.route.com" to an app. 
# Creates the route if not present
cf map-route [app-name] route.com -n myapp

# Unmap "myapp.route.com" from an app. 
# Creates the route if not present
cf unmap-route [app-name] route.com -n myapp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="application-management">Application Management</h4>

<p>To deploy a new app or update an existing one we need to <strong>push</strong> its code to the Cloud Foundry instance. The <em>push</em> command has many optional arguments which depend on
the type. However, it’s better to specify all these arguments in a system file called <em>manifest.yml</em> which is a special file for Cloud Foundry.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Start a new app called "myapp"
# If there's a manifest.yml in the current folder, 
# the config will be read from there
cf push
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">myNodejsapp</span>
  <span class="na">memory</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">256M</span>
  <span class="na">disk_quota</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">512M</span>
  <span class="na">buildpack</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">nodejs_buildpack</span>
  <span class="na">host</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">my-new-nodejsapp</span>
  <span class="na">domain</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">mybluemix.net</span>
  <span class="na">command</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">node app.js</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example we specify the resource requirements, buildpack, route (host:domain), and a starting command.</p>

<p>After an application is started, we can easily manage its state and resources.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Start, stop, restart app
cf start [app-name]
cf stop [app-name]
cf restart [app-name]

# Delete the app and its routes
cf delete [app-name] -r

# Manually scale the app
cf scale [app-name] -i [num-instances] -m [memory-size]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When things go wrong, we will need to check the app’s log and configuration.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># List all environment variables of the app
cf env [app-name]

# Tail in real time the app's log
cf logs [app-name]

# Check the latest app log
cf logs --recent [app-name]

# Check the latest events - e.g. restarting, deployment
cf events [app-name]
</code></pre></div></div>

Almost every other architectural component is classified as <strong>service</strong>. In Cloud Foundry, services can be <strong>attached</strong> to an application so that it can use them.</p>

<p>For example, data bases, data analytics APIs, pub-sub systems, and even autoscaling can be implemented as services. Whenever the application logic needs to know about a sevice instance (e.g. to connect to a database), this information is provided via the <strong>VCAP_SERVICES</strong> environment variable, which is a JSON string. The application is responsible 
to parse it and connect with the specified endpoints and credentials.</p>

<p>Let’s see how to work with services:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># List all available services 
cf marketplace

# Check out an individual service offering
cf marketplace -s [service-name]

# List all available service instances in the space
cf services

# Create a new service instance with a plan (e.g. Free, Lite, Paid)
cf create-service [service-name] [plan] [new-service-instance-name]

# Delete a service instance
cf delete-service [service-instance-name]

# Bind a service instance to an app
cf bind-service [app-name] [service-instance-name]

# Unbind a service instance from an app
cf unbind-service [app-name] [service-instance-name]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Cloud Foundry allows us to wrap existing/legacy systems (e.g. on-premise data bases) as service instance through the <strong>cups_command</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, an app can specify its service instance dependencies in the <em>manifest.yml</em> file, hence when pushed it will automatically bind to the respective service instances.</p>
